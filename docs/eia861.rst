Background
^^^^^^^^^^

According to law **XXXX** must fill out the form?

.. todo::
    Say more about legal background.

The *Annual Electric Power Industry Report*, also known as Form EIA-861, elicits
information from respondents regarding load, generation, capacity, sales, revenues,
programs, and more. The EIA-861 exists in parallel with its "short form" counterpart,
the EIA-861S, which is not yet included in the pudl database. The short form was
created in 2012 and, true to it's name, serves as a truncated version of the full
form, intended to reduce the respondent burden for smaller reporting entities.
Approximately 1,100 utilities complete the EIA-861S and 2,300 utilities complete
the full EIA-861.

EIA also solicits information for a *Monthly Electric Power Industry Report*, the
EIA-861M, however all the monthly information is encapsulated in the Annual EIA-861.
**pudl only draws from EIA-861M in the event that a user requests year-to-date
information that isn't yet available in its annual form.**

.. todo::
    Confirm the role of EIA-861M in pudl

Respondents to the Form EIA-861 include public and investor-owned utilities,
electric cooperatives, retail power marketers, third-party solar system operators,
and more. Once the respondent utilities have submitted their data, the EIA
creates a series of spreadsheets that reflect themes within the form. These
spreadsheets have changed over the years as the form itself evolves. To gain
greater insight into year-to-year nuances of the form, we recommend downloading
the EIA-861 zip files for the desired years from the `EIA website
<https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/>`__ and scrutinizing both the Form
and the Form Instructions files.
`Form EIA-861 FAQ <https://www.eia.gov/survey/form/eia_861/faqs.php>`__, can also
provide clarity on the contents of the data.

Notable Irregularities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For proprietary reasons, power marketer data can appear unaffiliated for
up to nine months after reporting. As a result, several entries sport the uniform
utility id ``88888``. EIA also performs state-level adjustments for **XXX**. These
adjustments appear under the utility id ``99999``. They are useful for state-level
aggregation, but do not apply to utility-level analysis.

.. todo::
    Say more about the state-level adjustments (99999) and maybe why power marketer
    data is guarded.

Not all of the EIA-861 data span all years. As mentioned above, both the Form and
its output files have changed over time; most notably between 2012 and
2013. Beginning in 2013, the EIA split it's Demand Side Management spreadsheet
into two: Demand Response and Energy Efficiency in order to reduce ambiguity and
ensure data reliability. While there are many similarities between the two years,
EIA officials recommend against combining data across these years, citing to differences
in Form questions. For these fields, the post-2012 data from the DR and
EE spreadsheets are considered more accurate.

PUDL Data Transformations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These raw inputs are extracted by pudl, cleaned, and transformed for storage in
the database. The data from each of these tables can be accessed either by
querying the SQL database or interacting with pudl output tables.

.. note::
    Add transformation details about the EIA861 output tables.
