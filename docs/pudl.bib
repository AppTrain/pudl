  abstract={
     Scientific data have traditionally been distributed via downloads from data server
     to local computer. This way of working suffers from limitations as scientific
     datasets grow toward the petabyte scale. A “cloud-native data repository,” as
     defined in this article, offers several advantages over traditional data
     repositories-performance, reliability, cost-effectiveness, collaboration,
     reproducibility, creativity, downstream impacts, and access and inclusion. These
     objectives motivate a set of best practices for cloud-native data repositories:
     analysis-ready data, cloud-optimized (ARCO) formats, and loose coupling with
     data-proximate computing. The Pangeo Project has developed a prototype
     implementation of these principles by using open-source scientific Python tools. By
     providing an ARCO data catalog together with on-demand, scalable distributed
     computing, Pangeo enables users to process big data at rates exceeding 10 GB/s.
     Several challenges must be resolved in order to realize cloud computing's full
     potential for scientific research, such as organizing funding, training users, and
     enforcing data privacy requirements.

      AI models are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains like health and
      conservation.  Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due
      to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection,
      wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most
      under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data
      practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India,
      East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present
      empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative,
      downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that
      undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92% prevalence), invisible,
      delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and
      incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer
      and more robust systems for all.

	abstract = {In an era of U.S. energy abundance, the persistently high energy bills paid by low-income households is troubling. After decades of weatherization and bill-payment programs, low-income households still spend a higher percent of their income on electricity and gas bills than any other income group. Their energy burden is not declining, and it remains persistently high in particular geographies such as the South, rural America, and minority communities. As public agencies and utilities attempt to transition to a sustainable energy future, many of the programs that promote energy efficiency, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries are largely inaccessible to low-income households due to affordability barriers. This review describes the ecosystem of stakeholders and programs, and identifies promising opportunities to address low-income energy affordability, such as behavioral economics, data analytics, and leveraging health care benefits. Scalable approaches require linking programs and policies to tackle the complex web of causes and impacts faced by financially constrained households.}

Unabated gas plants’ future role in the power system should be predominantly limited to
backup reserve to allow for flexible low carbon forms of supply to fully emerge.  Events
in 2021 have brought the extreme levels of price and supply volatility present in the
global gas market to the fore of discussions over future energy system dynamics.
Wholesale gas prices have risen to record highs across key supply hubs, highlighting the
levels of  market  risk  that  gas-fired  power  stations  are  exposed  to,  and
demonstrating  the  urgent  requirement for increased investment in alternative forms of
flexible supply which are steadily emerging.  Even before this year’s crisis however,
gas-fired power stations across Europe and the US were already  confronting  declining
operating  profitability  and  rapidly  growing competition  from  low carbon sources. A
steady shift towards the primary use of such technologies is vital if net zero emissions
goals are to be achieved.  While small amounts of unabated gas-fired capacity may well
be required to remain available in these regions and to sit predominantly idle as back
up peaking capacity to ensure long- term system supply security, we believe that this
should be the limit to such units’ future role.  This report aims to demonstrate that
stakeholders committing to the long-term funding of such assets are already risking the
