`Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems
<https://www.epa.gov/emc/emc-continuous-emission-monitoring-systems>`__ (CEMS) are used
to determine the rate of gas or particulate matter exiting a point source of emissions.
The EPA `Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) <https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets>`__
has collected emissions data from CEMS units stretching back to 1995. Among the data
included in CEMS are hourly gross load, SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions.

Who is required to install CEMS and report to EPA?

`Part 75 <https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=d20546b42dd4ea978d0de7eabe15cbf4&mc=true&n=pt40.18.75&r=PART&ty=HTML#se40.18.75_12>`__
of the Federal Code of Regulations (FRC), the backbone of the Clean Air Act Title IV and
Acid Rain Program, requires coal and other solid-combusting units (see §72.2) to install
and use CEMS (see §75.2, §72.6). Certain low-sulfur fueled gas and oil units (see §72.2)
may seek exemption or alternative means of monitoring their emissions if desired (see
§§75.23, §§75.48, §§75.66). Once CEMS are installed, Part 75 requires hourly data
recording, including during startup, shutdown, and instances of malfunction as well as
quarterly data reporting to the EPA. The regulation further details the protocol for
missing data calculations and backup monitoring for instances of CEMS failure (see
§§75,31-37).

A plain English explanation of the requirements of Part 75 is available in section
`2.0 Overview of Part 75 Monitoring Requirements <https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/plain_english_guide_to_the_part_75_rule.pdf>`__

EPA CAMD publishes the CEMS data in an online `data portal <https://campd.epa.gov/>`__.
The files are available in a prepackaged format, accessible via a `user interface <https://campd.epa.gov/data/custom-data-download>`__
or `FTP site <https://gaftp.epa.gov/DMDnLoad/>`__ with each downloadable zip file

{% block notable_irregularities %}

CEMS is enourmous
-----------------
CEMS is by far the largest dataset in PUDL what with hourly records for
thousands of plants spanning decades. For this reason, we house CEMS data in `Apache
Parquet <https://parquet.apache.org/>`__ files rather than the main PUDL database.
Still, running the ETL with all of the CEMS data can take a long time. Note that you can
:ref:`process CEMS Data seperately <add-cems-later>` from the main ETL
script if you'd like.

Check out the `EPA CEMS example notebook <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-examples/blob/main/notebooks/03-pudl-parquet.ipynb>`__
in our `pudl-examples repository <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-examples>`__
on GitHub for pointers on how to access this dataset efficiently using :mod:`dask`.

EPA units vs. EIA units
-----------------------
Another important thing to note is the difference between EPA "units" vs EIA "units".
Power plants are complex entities that have multiple subcomponents. In fossil powered
plants, emissions come from the combusion of fuel. This occurs in the boiler for coal
plants or the gas turbine for gas plants. When the EPA uses the term "unit" it is
refering to the emissions unit or smokestack where the CEMS equipment are (i.e., the
boiler or gas turbine). When the EIA refers to a "unit" it's usually refering to the
electricity generating unit (i.e. the generator). Some plants have a one-to-one
relationship between boilers and generators or gas turbines and generators, but many do
not.

The EPA and EIA have addressed this discrepancy by creating a `crosswalk
<https://github.com/USEPA/camd-eia-crosswalk>`__ between the
various sub-plant groupings reported to them. The ``plant_id_eia`` values from the
crosswalk are integrated into the EPA CEMS Parquet files available in PUDL.

Take a look at this helpful depiction of plant types from the EPA's crosswalk repo.
