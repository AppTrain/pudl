The data we've integrated from FERC Form 714 records hourly electricity demand by
utility or balancing authority from 2006-2020, and provides a small crosswalk table that
allows those utilities and balancing authorities to be linked to their EIA IDs.

The hourly demand data for 2006-2020 is about 15 million records. There are about 200
respondents that show up in the "Respondent ID" crosswalk table.

Given the EIA IDs, we can link the hourly electricity demand to a particular
georgraphic region at the county level, because utilities and balancing authorities
report their service territories in :doc:`eia861`, and from that information we can
estimate historical hourly electricity demand by state.

It could also be interesting to combine this hourly demand data with the hourly
emissions and unit-level generation data from :doc:`epacems`.

Electric utilities operating balancing authority areas and planning areas with annual
peak demand over 200MW are required to file FERC Form 714.

{% block original_data %}
There are several epochs of FERC-714 and its predecessor data, published in various
formats:

* **1993-1999**: Data collected by NERC regions without standardized electronic filing.
* **1999-2004**: Data collected by FERC without standardized electronic filing.
* **2005**: Data collected by FERC without standardized electronic filing, but not posted on
  their website, and only available through the regulatory filing eLibrary.
* **2006-2020**: Standardized electronic filing. ASCII encoded CSV files exported from
  a VisualFoxPro database.
* **2021-present**: Standardized electronic filing using the XBRL (eXtensible Business
  Reporting Language) dialect of XML.

We only have plans to integrate the data from the standardized electronic reporting era
since the format of the earlier data varies for each reporting balancing authority and
utility, and would be very labor intensive to parse and reconcile.

{% block notable_irregularities %}

The original hourly electricity demand time series is plagued with timezone and daylight
savings vs. standard time irregularities, which we have done our best to clean up. The
timestamps in the clean data are all in UTC, with a timezone code stored in a separate
column, so that the times can be easily localized or converted. It's certainly not
perfect, but its much better than the original data and it's easy to work with!

Not all respondents use the same sign convention for reporting "demand." The vast
majority consider demand / load that they serve to be a positive number, and so we've
standardized the data to use that convention.

There are a lot of reporting gaps, especially for smaller respondents. Sometimes these
are brief, and sometimes they are entire years. There are also a number of outliers and
suspicious values (e.g. a long series of identical consecutive values). We have some
tools that we've built to clean up these outliers in
:mod:`pudl.analysis.timeseries_cleaning`.

Because utilities and balancing authorities occasionally change their service
territories or merge, the demand reproted by any individual "respondent" may correspond
to wildly different consumers in different years. To make it at least somewhat possible
to compare the reported data across time, we've also compiled historical service
territory maps for the respondents based on data reported in :doc:`eia861`. However,
it's not always easy to identify which EIA utility or balancing authority corresponds to
a FERC-714 respondent. See the :class:`pudl.output.ferc714.Respondent` class for some
tooling that we've built to address this issue. Other code that underlies this work can
be found in :mod:`pudl.analysis.service_territory` and :mod:`pudl.analysis.spatial`.

The :mod:`pudl.analysis.state_demand` script brings together all of the above to
estimate historical hourly electricity demand by state for 2006-2020.
